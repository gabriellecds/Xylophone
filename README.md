# Xylophone

The Xylophone app was the first more complex app that I made. Concepts like setting all the buttons in the right place and color, connecting the buttons with the ViewController, and making each of them play different sounds, were quite challenging for a beginner. With this app, I also learned how to search on Stack Overflow, Apple Documentation, and how to find solutions effectively and on my own. In summary, with this app, I was able to learn:

* How to play sound using AVFoundation and AVAudioPlayer.
* Understanding Apple documentation and how to use Stack Overflow.
* Functions and methods in Swift.
* Data types.
* Swift loops.
* Variable scope.
* The ViewController lifecycle.
* Error handling in Swift.
* Code refactoring.
* Basic debugging.
